# Machine Learning to Everyone

In recent years, there appears a lot of websites for understanding machine learning.
They are so helpful but I feel they still require some basic knowledge before taking in the grace of machine learning world, from my experience.
This is why I compose this website.

In this website, I try to share where those difficulties stand and how to overcome them.

I hope both readers and the author can learn ML deeper together and share thought about ML.
